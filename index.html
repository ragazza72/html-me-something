        <h4> Guitars </h4>
            <p class="thing"> Guitars are pretty cool. They can be electric. Meaning they have to be 
                plugged into some sort of amplification device. They can also be acoustic. These 
                do not need to be plugged into some sort of amplification device. They can also be
                electric-acoustic. These are acoustic guitars that may also be plugged into some sort
                of amplification device if so desired.
